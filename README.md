PROJECT DESCRIPTION ON PET BOARDING MANAGEMENT

Creating a full-stack application for pet boarding management involves developing both the frontend and backend components to manage pet bookings, user profiles, payments, and administrative tasks.
Core Features of our project are:

1.	User Authentication and Profiles
•	Allow users (pet owners, administrators) to register, log in, and manage their accounts.
•	Collect user information such as contact details, pet information, and preferences.
2.	Pet Booking Management
•	Enable pet owners to book boarding services for their pets by specifying dates, duration, and any special requirements.
•	Provide availability calendars for different boarding facilities or services.
3.	Pet Profiles and Medical Records
•	Allow pet owners to create profiles for their pets with details like name, breed, age, medical history, vaccinations, and dietary preferences.
•	Upload and store medical records and vaccination certificates securely.
4.	Availability and Reservations
•	Manage availability of boarding facilities and services based on capacity and scheduling.
•	Handle reservations, confirmations, cancellations, and waitlists.
5.	Payment Integration
•	Integrate payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to facilitate secure online payments for bookings.
•	Provide users with payment confirmation and receipts.

Some additional features which make us stand-out are:
1. Special Care Instructions
2. Loyalty Programs and Discounts including community support
3. Diet and Nutrition Management
4. Social and Community Features for meetups and advice
